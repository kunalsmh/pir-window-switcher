## Using PIR motion sensor to detect if someone is entering the room
The motion sensor sends an API request to the local hosted server if someone is detected and opens the defined file/app.

### Hardware used
- ESP32 (5$)
- hc-sr501 (1$)

The board is powered with my personal 10,000Mah spare power bank but it can be powered with a cheap lipo battery or directly through your laptop/pc.

### Flashing the code into the board and hosting a local API server

1. Clone this repo and open the src file
2. Configure the platform.ini according to your board
3. Inside server.py, replace `pdf_path` with your file path
4. Go to main.cpp, replace your `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, `API_URL` with your credentials
5. Place the device where you want the sensor to detect presence

- The API server runs in the background, close it from system tray to end the process.

###### I use this so my parents think i'm always studying but you can use this however you want haha
